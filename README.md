# MOGWAI DOCS

![MOGWAI](./Images/img01.png)

This repository contains the documentation on the [MOGWAI runtime](https://www.mogwai.eu.com).

The PDF-format documentation is available as releases. 
Other documents will be added gradually (still in the form of releases).

Please note that for now all the documents are in French.
Their translation is planned and will be released as soon as possible.
But the documentation comes with examples that are easy to reproduce even if you do not understand French.

And yes, as you have most likely guessed, MOGWAI runtime is a little French…
